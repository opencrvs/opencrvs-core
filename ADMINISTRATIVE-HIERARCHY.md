2. Administrative areas form the jurisdictional hierarchy of a country.
3. Administrative area may contain locations.
4. Locations are specific places like offices or health facilities. Locations **do not** form independent hierarchy outside of administrative areas.
5. All users must belong to a location.
6. Type of a location is arbitrary\*

\* Until 2.0 is completed, field type `FACILITY` renders locations of type `HEALTH_FACILITY`.
