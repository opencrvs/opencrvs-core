# Events Service

Service for managing custom events

## API Overview

### tRPC

All endpoints are exposed via a [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) API.

### REST

Selected endpoints are also available as RESTful APIs, generated from the tRPC routes using [`trpc-to-openapi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trpc-to-openapi).

These REST endpoints are primarily intended for country system integrations â€” for example, sending event notifications via API.

The OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation for these REST APIs is generated by [/packages/api-docs](/packages/api-docs/).

## Development

### Practices

Refer to the [Client README](../client/src/v2-events/README.md) for coding conventions, folder structure, and best practices.

### Glossary

Terminology and domain-specific concepts are explained in the [Glossary](../client/src/v2-events/GLOSSARY.md).

### Style Guide

## Testing

- **Coverage**: Each endpoint must have corresponding tests.
- **Fixtures**: Global test setup expects the use of the [tennis-club-membership-event fixture](../commons/src/fixtures/tennis-club-membership-event.ts) returned from the country-configuration service.
- **Dynamic Tests**: Test generators use this fixture to dynamically create action data.  
  Validation is based on dynamic configuration provided by the fixture.
