| Entity            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Event             | A life event (e.g., dog adoption). Represents a full entry in the system that includes the history of all steps (actions) taken during the process.                                                                     |
| EventConfig       | Defines how an event works for a specific country. Includes setup for steps in the process (`Action`) and the data collected (`Declaration`).                                                                           |
| EventInput        | A subset of event data used when creating or updating an event.                                                                                                                                                         |
| EventIndex        | A search-friendly version of an event. Contains static fields shared across all event types and custom fields based on the event's configuration.                                                                       |
| Date of event     | When the primary trigger for the creation of this record happened (e.g., child's date of birth, deceased's date of death). Default is the creation moment of the event if nothing else is defined. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| Draft             | An unsubmitted action. Stored with event details, creator info, and timestamp. Drafts are deleted once the action is committed.                                                                                         |
| User              | A user of the system. Could be a practitioner, admin, or other role.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Location          | A physical place—like an office or administrative region. Not someone's personal home.                                                                                                                                  |
| Action            | A system-triggered step that causes a status change in the event. Can be a declaration (updates data), "system state action" (`READ`, `ARCHIVE`) or a record action (affects the event after it's registered).          |
| ActionConfig      | Defines what’s required to complete a specific action. Each action has its own setup. Actions can append annotations that complements the declaration. Action may define a separate form.                               |
| PageConfig        | Describes a page in a declaration or action form. Each form can have multiple pages, each with multiple fields. Pages can be of type `FORM` or `VERIFICATION`.                                                          |
| Event Data        | The evolving blob of data for an event, built from past declaration actions. It follows the structure defined in the declaration config.                                                                                |
| (Action) Metadata | Extra data tied to a specific action—like comments, payment info, ID verification, or signatures.                                                                                                                       |
