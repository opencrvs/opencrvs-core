// In production, we register a service worker to serve assets from local cache.

// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives
// it offline capabilities. However, it also means that developers (and users)
// will only see deployed updates on the 'N+1' visit to a page, since previously
// cached resources are updated in the background.

// To learn more about the benefits of this model, read https://goo.gl/KwvDNy.
// This link also includes instructions on opting out of this behavior.
