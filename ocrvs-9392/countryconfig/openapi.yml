                            \    This property
                            determines whether to add a prefix (such as
                            \"Child\" or \"Applicant\") before the field label\ 

                            \    when rendering
                            search parameter labels — for example, in the search
                            results page to indicate which fields were used in
                            the search.


                            \    For example, a
                            field config like { id: \"child.firstname\", label:
                            { defaultMessage: \"First Name(s)\" } } would render
                            as \"First Name(s)\" by default.


                            \    A field config like
                            { id: \"mother.firstname\", label: { defaultMessage:
                            \"First Name(s)\" } } would also render as \"First
                            Name(s)\" by default.


                            \    So, if both
                            child.firstname and mother.firstname are used in a
                            search, the resulting search criteria labels would
                            be \"First Name(s)\", \"First Name(s)\",\ 

                            \    which is ambiguous.


                            \    Now, if we treat
                            the field ID prefix as a label (e.g.,
                            \"applicant.firstname\" → \"Applicant\"), and the
                            field label is already\ 

                            \    descriptive — like
                            { id: \"applicant.firstname\", label: {
                            defaultMessage: \"Applicant's First Name\" } } —
                            then the resulting\ 

                            \    label would be
                            \"Applicant Applicant's First Name\", which is
                            redundant and awkward.


                            \    By setting
                            searchCriteriaLabelPrefix to a translation config
                            object, we can explicitly define the desired

                            based on other field values. Since the advanced

                            \    This property
                            determines whether to add a prefix (such as
                            \"Child\" or \"Applicant\") before the field label\ 

                            \    when rendering
                            search parameter labels — for example, in the search
                            results page to indicate which fields were used in
                            the search.


                            \    For example, a
                            field config like { id: \"child.firstname\", label:
                            { defaultMessage: \"First Name(s)\" } } would render
                            as \"First Name(s)\" by default.


                            \    A field config like
                            { id: \"mother.firstname\", label: { defaultMessage:
                            \"First Name(s)\" } } would also render as \"First
                            Name(s)\" by default.


                            \    So, if both
                            child.firstname and mother.firstname are used in a
                            search, the resulting search criteria labels would
                            be \"First Name(s)\", \"First Name(s)\",\ 

                            \    which is ambiguous.


                            \    Now, if we treat
                            the field ID prefix as a label (e.g.,
                            \"applicant.firstname\" → \"Applicant\"), and the
                            field label is already\ 

                            \    descriptive — like
                            { id: \"applicant.firstname\", label: {
                            defaultMessage: \"Applicant's First Name\" } } —
                            then the resulting\ 

                            \    label would be
                            \"Applicant Applicant's First Name\", which is
                            redundant and awkward.


                            \    By setting
                            searchCriteriaLabelPrefix to a translation config
                            object, we can explicitly define the desired

                            searchCriteriaLabelPrefix: TranslationConfig }).

                            search, we sometimes need to override the default

                            \       For example,

                            \       that hides them
                            based on other field values. Since the advanced
                            search form reuses\ 

                            \       the declaration
                            form config, those same conditionals would apply by

                            \       However, in
                            advanced search we often want to make all Informant
